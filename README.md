- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VivaceJamiel

My full name is Jamiel Impoy.
I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate studying at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
I'm pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering

I hope to become a future Software Engineer and help make something that can leave a lasting legacy.
Also I would just like to live a little less stressed about life than I currently am right now.

As of October 2021, I currently reside in the Chicagoland area and plan on moving west after graduating. 
A goal in life right now would be to earn enough to live in a nice area that I can relax and enjoy my hobbies and pursue my increasingly growing curiosity in Computer Science.

I have yet to get an internship at a company and right now I'm working on projects to bolster my resume and develop a website to host my projects on for recruiters to explore
This will be updated every now and then to keep up with my life but here's to hoping for a brighter future.
